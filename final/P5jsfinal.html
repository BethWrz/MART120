	<h1>Beth Wrzesinski's Final p5.js Interactive Artwork</h1>
	
	<p>
	This is a recreation of Main Hall here on campus! I decided to code this because it's an iconic image that describes UM. It adds to the beauty and ambiance of campus with its brick and green roof and its bells ringing for all to hear. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	While I have finished the actual building I need your help to finish my masterpiece! 
	</p>
	
	<li>
	The M mountain is not in the right place... could you use your WASD keys to move it into place?
	</li>
	
	<li>
	It seems I forgot to add the M onto the mountian...could you use your mouse and click the canvas to add the M?
	</li>
	
	<p>
	I really appreciate the help!
	</p>
