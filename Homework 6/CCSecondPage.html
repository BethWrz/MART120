<h2><span class="specificstyle">The Story of the Dog</span></h2>
<span>One upon a time there was a little girl with flowing black hair that only wished for a dog. Every birthday, Christmas, or other time she could receive presents she only asked for a dog. Her parents say her dedication to an animal but where hesitant because of her tendency to get bored of things quickly. They however had been thinking of getting a pet more and decided to test their daughter. After their daughter arrived back from school she opened the door to a wrapped present waiting for her. She quickly unwrapped the present only to find a fish tank :( The little girl was devastated but once her parents told her they would get a dog if she could first show that she could care for an animal with minimal help from her parents, the girl excitedly walked to her room with the water sloshing over the sides.

<br/>

Months go by with the little girl working hard to care for her new pet

<br/>

Finally on her birthday arriving the little girl excitedly hops out of bed and walks downstairs. To her surprise she was attacked by a small black ball of fur. She excitedly holds the dog closer and thanks her parents.

<br/>

She lived happily ever after with her fish and dog!</span>
