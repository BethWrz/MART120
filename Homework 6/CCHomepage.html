<h2><span class="specificstyle">List of my FAVORITE Restaurants</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b> City View</b></li>

<span> This is my favorite restaurant to visit when I am in San Francisco! I have been going since I was a kid with my family. They serve dim sum off of a cart or you can order off of the menu. Whenever I go there I eat until I am stuffed!</span>

<li><b>Dave's Sushi</b></li>

<span>I love sushi and this is my favorite place to go in Bozeman. My favorite roll is the Ed's Happenin'. It has tempura fried shrimp and spicy mayo!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.</span>

<li><b>Feast</b></li>

<span>While I may be a bit bias because I worked here, their burger is my favorite hands down. It has amazing fries and fry sauce served with it. The burger itself comes with mango chutney, stout mustard, arugula, and bacon. This was my favorite thing to order after a hard shift.</span>
